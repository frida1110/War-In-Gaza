<h1>War in Gaza</h1>
<p> <b>Israeli</b> Prime Minister <i>Benjamin</i> <i>Netanyahu</i> rejected what he said were conditions proposed by Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, including the end of the war and the withdrawal of <b>Israeli</b> forces from the Strip. <b>Israeli</b> forces appeared to ramp up ground and aeri`al attacks overnight around the southern Gazan city of <i>Khan</i> <i>Younis</i>, according to local media and eyewitnesses, after Israel’s defense minister said operations there were “in full swing.”

<p><b>Israeli</b> Foreign Minister <b>Israeli</b> Katz is expected to address a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. Katz’s visit is part of a <i>“diplomatic campaign”</i> to secure E.U. support to get hostages released from Gaza and to promote economic projects, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said.</p>
